<h1>Don’t	check	your	phone.</h1>
    Do	you	find	yourself	reaching	for	your	phone	the	second	
you’re	awake?	With	easy	access	to	so	many	instant	updates,	this	is	a	common	
practice	– but	not	necessarily	a	healthy	one.	Studies	suggest	that	constantly	checking	
notifications	can	trigger	stress	and	anxiety	– not	a	healthy	way	to	start	the	day!
</div>
  <div class="routine">
  

 <h1> Don’t	rush	your	routine. </h1>
   The	way	you	start	your	morning	will	set	the	tone	for	the	
rest	of	your	day.	Wake	up	early	enough	to	feel	calm,	composed	and	capable	of	
accomplishing	everything	you	need	to	do.
  </div>
  <div class="workout">
  
<h1>Don’t	skip	your	workout.</h1>
  Studies	from	the	University	of	Nottingham	show	that	our	
energy	levels	are	highest	at	the	beginning of	the	day	– so you	will	want	to work	out	
first	thing	in	the	morning	before	that	energy	fades. Though	it	might	seem	tempting	
to	replace	working	out	with	a	few	more	minutes	of	sleep, you	will	feel	less	motivated	
to	work out	later	in	the	day	while	other	activities	(work,	picking	up	the	kids,	etc.),
take	priority. Work	out	first	thing	each	morning	to	make	sure	it	gets	done!

  </div>
  <div class="water">
<h1>Do	drink	water.</h1>
  Many	people	start	out	their	day	with	a	cup	of	coffee,	but	it’s	
healthier to	drink	water	first	thing	in	the	morning.	Water	will	help	rehydrate	your	
body	and	will	allow	for	better	digestion when	you	eat.	
  </div>
  <div class="early">
  
<h1>Do	keep	to	a	regular	sleeping	schedule.</h1>	
  Your	body	likes	consistency – it	will	be	
easier	to	get	up	each	morning	if	you	go	to	bed	and	wake	up	at	the	same	time	every	
day.	Waking	up	early	will	help	establish	your	sleeping	schedule as	well	as	improve	
your	quality	of	sleep.
